# Machine-Learning-CSGO-Winner-Predictor

A Colab Notebook with an extensive preprocessing and model research made in order to predict a CSGO winner.. The purpose of this work was to achieve the greatest possible accuracy with new data on a Kaggle ML competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ml-21-22-p2.

The notebook has been separated into the following parts:
- Libraries and Data Load
- Initial Study
- Preprocessing
- Save Predictions
- Models

In the end, our best model was Random Forest with a Nevergrad hyperparameters optimization.
